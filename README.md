Furthermore, the analysis highlights the detrimental impact of overtime on attrition rates, emphasizing the need to manage workload and promote work-life balance. Lastly, age distribution analysis indicates a higher attrition rate among younger employees, suggesting the importance of targeted retention strategies for this demographic.

3. Invest in Employee Development: Offer training and development programs to enhance skills and competencies, providing employees with opportunities for advancement and growth within the company.

4. Manage Overtime: Monitor and manage overtime hours to prevent employee burnout and dissatisfaction, ensuring that workload is distributed effectively and promoting a healthy work-life balance.

5. Tailored Retention Strategies: Develop targeted retention strategies for younger employees, including mentorship programs, career planning initiatives, and opportunities for skill development, to improve retention rates within this demographic.
