### Conclusion
The analysis of employee attrition at Jaya Jaya Maju reveals several key insights that can inform human resource management strategies to address the high attrition rate. Firstly, there is a significant correlation between job satisfaction levels and attrition rates, with employees reporting lower job satisfaction more likely to leave the company. Similarly, WorkLifeBalance plays a crucial role in employee retention, with employees experiencing higher levels of WorkLifeBalance exhibiting lower attrition rates. Additionally, tenure at the company shows a negative correlation with attrition, indicating that longer-tenured employees are less likely to leave. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the detrimental impact of overtime on attrition rates, emphasizing the need to manage workload and promote work-life balance. Lastly, age distribution analysis indicates a higher attrition rate among younger employees, suggesting the importance of targeted retention strategies for this demographic.

### Recommendations
1. Enhance Job Satisfaction: Implement measures to improve job satisfaction among employees, such as providing opportunities for career growth, recognizing achievements, and fostering a positive work environment.

2. Promote Work-Life Balance: Develop policies and initiatives to enhance WorkLifeBalance, including flexible work arrangements, wellness programs, and stress management resources, to reduce attrition rates associated with burnout and work-related stress.

3. Invest in Employee Development: Offer training and development programs to enhance skills and competencies, providing employees with opportunities for advancement and growth within the company.

4. Manage Overtime: Monitor and manage overtime hours to prevent employee burnout and dissatisfaction, ensuring that workload is distributed effectively and promoting a healthy work-life balance.

5. Tailored Retention Strategies: Develop targeted retention strategies for younger employees, including mentorship programs, career planning initiatives, and opportunities for skill development, to improve retention rates within this demographic.

By implementing these recommendations, Jaya Jaya Maju can mitigate attrition rates, enhance employee retention, and foster a more engaged and productive workforce.
